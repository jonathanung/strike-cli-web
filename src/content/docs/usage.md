# Usage

## Slash commands

strike launches without any provider configured. Pick one inside the TUI:

```
/provider                      # centered picker: providers + auth status;
                               # selecting an unauthenticated one starts its
                               # login and switches once it succeeds;
                               # ctrl+x logs out (y/n confirm)

### Session, memory, issues

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| `/session` | picker of past **root** sessions (auto-titles); resume reloads model history |
| `/session <id>` | resume that root session by id |
| `/fork` | copy the current session JSONL into a new id (idle only) |
| `/undo` / `/rewind` | undo last turn (idle only); bare opens picker; `chat` keeps disk; `files` restores per-file checkpoints from that turn (never `git reset --hard`) |
| `/export` | dump the visible transcript to markdown (user/assistant/tool summaries); redacts common API-key shapes; default path under `.strike/exports/` or tmp; `--open` launches `$EDITOR` |
| `/compact` | ask the engine to compact model history |
| `/memory` | bare = list browser; `list [tag]`, `get <key>`, `set <key> <value>`, `rm <key>`, `export [path]`, `import <path> [--replace]` (portable JSON; relative paths stay under project root) |
| `/issues` | bare = list browser; `list [open\|closed]`, `add <title>`, `get <id>`, `close <id>`, `export [path]`, `import <path> [--replace]` (same portable rules as memory) |
| `/context` | context doctor modal: layer sizes, history msg count, oversized warnings (previews redacted) |
| `/cost` | session input/output/cache totals from usage events; est. USD when catalog rates known; unknown stays explicit |
| `/init` | light local scan → write `AGENTS.md`; confirms before overwrite |
| `/mcp` | MCP status (`up`/`down`/`error`/`disabled`); `/mcp retry [name]`, `/mcp disable <name>` (see [config.md](/docs/mcp)) |

### Autonomy & workflows

`/autonomy` sets the session exit-gate policy for multi-phase workflows
(see [agents-skills.md](/docs/multi-agent)):

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `supervised` (default) | you approve phase gates |
| `agent` | model clears gates via `phase_done` |
| `checks` | configured check commands must exit 0 |

### Permission mode dial

`/mode` (or **Shift+Tab**) cycles the session **tool-permission posture**. This
is distinct from `/autonomy` (exit gates). The header always shows `mode …`;
yolo also paints a danger banner.

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `default` | normal ask rules (config + agent + phase) |
| `plan` | hard read-only write/edit deny; enters plan workflow |
| `soft-approve` | visible 15s countdown then allow once; veto anytime |
| `accept-edits` | auto-allow edit/write; bash/network still ask |
| `yolo` | skip permission asks; explicit deny rules still apply |

Persists per session in the JSONL log. Optional default for new sessions:
`permissionMode` in [config.md](/docs/config).

Built-in skills also appear as slash commands: `/commit`, `/push`, `/pr`,
`/ship`, `/review`, `/learn`, `/deslop`, `/verify` (plus custom skills under
discovery roots). See [agents-skills.md](/docs/multi-agent) and
[peer-ecosystem.md](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/blob/main/docs/peer-ecosystem.md).

### Composer: `@file` / `@folder` mentions

Type `@` then a path fragment for fuzzy project-file completion (needs
`host.Files`). Matching uses basename and full relative path. Directories
appear as `@path/`. An exact typed path is always offered when it exists under
the project root, even if it was outside the fuzzy top results.

**Index:** prefers `git ls-files` (honors `.gitignore`); otherwise walks the
project root. Default skips include `.plan`, `node_modules`, `.git`, `vendor`,
build outputs, and similar noise. Add more basename skips (one per line) in
`.strike/file-index-skip`.

**Expand on send:** `@file` attaches file contents (capped; binary/oversize
skipped with a notice). `@folder/` attaches an **immediate child listing
only** (not a recursive multi-file dump). Transcript/history keep the `@path`
tokens. Emails (`user@host`) are not treated as mentions. Paths cannot escape
the project root (symlink-safe).

Submitting a prompt before selecting shows "No model selected" in the
notice line above the composer (your prompt stays in the input). Talking to
a real provider needs credentials — see [auth.md](/docs/auth).

Provider selection happens in-app with `/provider`; `--provider` on the
command line just pre-selects (and validates credentials eagerly). Custom
OpenAI-/Anthropic-compatible endpoints: `/settings`, `.strike/providers.jsonc`,
or config `providers` — see [config.md](/docs/config).

## CLI session resume & headless exec

```sh
./strike --continue              # resume most recent root session
./strike --session <id>          # resume a specific root session by id
./strike exec "fix the flaky test"   # one-shot headless turn → stdout
./strike exec -                  # read prompt from stdin
```

`--continue` and `--session` cannot be combined. `strike exec` accepts the
same `--provider` / `--model` / `--effort` /
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` flags as the TUI. Permission and question
prompts cannot be answered interactively in exec; asks are rejected unless
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` is set (configured/agent denies still
apply). Full flag list: [install.md](/docs/install) or `strike --help`.

## UI

The screen has a full-width header, footer hints, and danger banner when
needed. Its left pane is one aggregate stack: `session` transcript, reserved
notice line, slash-command completion, and `prompt ❯` composer. The right
slot hosts one active window from the registry:

| Window | Role |
|---|---|
| `context` | setup summary (provider, model, agent, …) |
| `activity` | tools/tips / subagent status |
| `agents` | multi-root session/agent tree (concurrent roots + children) |
| `visualizer` | selected-node status, tokens/cost, activity sparkline |
| `files` | workspace file tree (`host.Files`) |
| `memory` | project memory browser |
| `issues` | project issue browser |
| `markdown` | markdown reader (`/md-read <path>`) |
| `editor` | embedded nvim/vim/nano PTY for `/vim` |

Related right-pane windows stack as **groups** when the pane is tall/wide
enough: session (`context`+`activity`), agents (`agents`+`visualizer`), and
project (`memory`+`issues`) share a 50/50 split (vertical in a side column,
horizontal in a bottom bar). `files`, `markdown`, and `editor` stay full-height
singles. Compact or narrow terminals collapse each group to one pane.

### Concurrent root sessions

Focus the `agents` pane to run several parent sessions side by side. The pane
footer (and empty state) list the controls; `/keys` / `f1` with the agents
pane focused leads with those rows under **Current focus**, then the full
cheatsheet (including **Agents** when not focused):

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `n` | spawn a new concurrent root |
| `enter` | activate the selected root (or open a child transcript) |
| `x` | interrupt the selected root or child |
| `j` / `k` | move |
| `f` | cycle filters (all / attention / working / ready / roots) |

Do not confuse these with:

- **`Tab`** — cycles **agent personas** (build, plan, explore, …) for the
  active composer, not root sessions.
- **`ctrl+x` leader chords** — navigate **child/subagent** transcripts nested
  under a parent; they do not create or switch concurrent roots.

Worktree isolation for second+ roots is configured via `worktree` in
[config.md](/docs/config). Full chord table: [keybinds.md](/docs/keybinds).

Vim-style pane keys (horizontal split): `ctrl+h` / `ctrl+l` focus the left
or right pane; `ctrl+j` / `ctrl+k` move focus within the active stack group
then to the next group (including bare LF from terminals that cannot
disambiguate `ctrl+j`). `ctrl+;` (or `/layout` / `/split`) toggles a vertical
top/bottom split and swaps those chords (focus becomes `ctrl+j`/`ctrl+k`,
cycle becomes `ctrl+h`/`ctrl+l`). `ctrl+p` opens the command palette; `f1`
(or `/keys`) opens a filterable keybind cheatsheet. Enter sends; Shift+Enter
(or Alt+Enter after enhanced CSI) inserts a newline. `pgup`/`pgdn` (and `ctrl+up`/`ctrl+down`)
scroll the transcript; `ctrl+t` jumps to the latest output. The transcript
sticks to the bottom while you are already anchored, and keeps your scroll
offset when you have scrolled up. Pickers, the command palette, and
permission prompts render as centered dialogs in the same panel style.
`/theme` opens the color-theme picker; `/theme <id>` applies one; `/theme
dark|light|auto` sets session appearance only.

The default horizontal split appears at 93 columns and above, with a minimum
60-column left pane, one-column gutter, and 32-column right pane. At 92
columns and below, only the active pane fills the full width. For a custom
gutter of width `g`, the split threshold is `60 + g + 32`. Vertical split uses
the full width and divides body height when there is room. Below 60 columns or
20 rows panels drop their borders ("compact mode") instead of clipping or
garbling. There is no window close state or plugin mechanism for panes.

A fresh session with an empty transcript shows a dashboard of fixed-height
cards in place of a blank viewport; when space allows, a Logo band sits above
the cards and the header still owns the compact brand. The dashboard always
shows keybindings. It shows get-started provider rows only when no provider is
selected or the selected provider needs authentication, with provider rows
bounded to fit (and a `/init` CTA when `AGENTS.md` is missing); first-run
onboarding also mentions `/init`. Agents and skills appear only when valid
configured entries exist; recent prompts only when prompt history exists. It
repacks to fit the terminal on resize and collapses to a single column when
narrow.
