# Install & build

## One-liner (recommended)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://strike.jonathanung.ca/install | bash
```

`https://strike.jonathanung.ca/install` is a **stable brand URL**. The marketing
site **proxies** (does not redirect) the install script body so
`curl … | bash` receives the script directly. Upstream source:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonathanung/strike/main/scripts/install.sh
```

Binaries are **not** hosted on the VPS long-term. The script resolves the
latest [GitHub Release](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/releases),
downloads the matching `strike_<tag>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz`, verifies
`checksums.txt` (sha256), and installs to `~/.strike/bin/strike` (no root).

Optional:

```sh
# skip editing ~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc
curl -fsSL https://strike.jonathanung.ca/install | bash -s -- --no-modify-path

# pin a tag
curl -fsSL https://strike.jonathanung.ca/install | bash -s -- --version=v0.1.0
# or: STRIKE_VERSION=v0.1.0 bash scripts/install.sh
```

After install, open a new shell (or `export PATH="$HOME/.strike/bin:$PATH"`)
and run:

```sh
strike version
strike
```

### Uninstall

```sh
rm -f ~/.strike/bin/strike
# optional: remove config/sessions (destructive)
# rm -rf ~/.strike
```

Remove any `PATH` line you added for `~/.strike/bin` from your shell rc.

## Upgrade

```sh
strike --upgrade
# or inside the TUI:
/upgrade
```

Self-update fetches the latest GitHub Release, verifies the archive checksum,
and atomically replaces the running binary. `strike upgrade` / `strike --upgrade`
exits back to the shell when done; `/upgrade` in the TUI restarts the app.
Config and sessions under `~/.strike` are never deleted. If the binary is not
writable (e.g. installed system-wide), re-run the install script or use your
package manager.

**Autoupdate notify:** config `autoupdate` (`notify` default, or `off` / `auto`)
runs a non-blocking GitHub Releases check at TUI startup (at most once per 24h).
When a newer release exists, the status bar nudges you toward `/upgrade` (and
may desktop-notify per the `notify` dial). `auto` is opt-in and only replaces a
writable non-Nix binary; Nix installs always get a lock/input hint instead.
See [config.md](/docs/config#autoupdate-autoupdate).

Windows self-update is unsupported in v1; re-download from Releases.

## Nix

The repository flake builds `strike` from source, so NixOS does not depend on
the FHS layout used by release binaries. Install it into your user profile:

```sh
nix profile install github:jonathanung/strike
```

Run it without installing:

```sh
nix run github:jonathanung/strike
```

For a declarative flake or Home Manager configuration, add the input and use
its default package:

```nix
{
  inputs.strike = {
    url = "github:jonathanung/strike";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };
}
```

Pass `strike` to Home Manager through `extraSpecialArgs`:

```nix
homeConfigurations.your-user = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
  inherit pkgs;
  extraSpecialArgs = { inherit strike; };
  modules = [ ./home.nix ];
};
```

Then install it in a Home Manager module:

```nix
{ pkgs, strike, ... }:
{
  home.packages = [
    strike.packages.${pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.system}.default
  ];
}
```

When the package is installed through Nix, upgrade it by updating the lockfile
that pins the `strike` input rather than using `strike --upgrade`. Startup
autoupdate detects `/nix/store` binaries and never attempts binary replace.

## Domain / DNS (ops)

Configure `strike.jonathanung.ca` with TLS. Container nginx on this site:

| Public URL | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `https://strike.jonathanung.ca/install` | **Proxy** to raw `scripts/install.sh` on the strike default branch (script body, not an HTML redirect) |
| `https://strike.jonathanung.ca/` | Marketing site + on-domain `/docs` |
| `https://strike.jonathanung.ca/latest` (optional) | GitHub Releases latest |

Smoke:

```sh
curl -fsSL -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://strike.jonathanung.ca/install
# expect 200 and a shell script body (not a redirect HTML page)
curl -fsSL https://strike.jonathanung.ca/install | head
```

## Build from source

Requires Go 1.26+ (`brew install go`).

```sh
make setup          # one-time: creates ~/.strike (config + example
                    # plan agent and commit skill); never overwrites
make restore        # repair missing/corrupt ~/.strike layout
                    # (or: strike restore [--project])
make build          # builds ./strike with version/commit ldflags
make run-echo       # offline dev loop — no API key needed. Type
                    # `run <command>` to exercise tool dispatch and the
                    # permission prompt.
make run            # real agent with your configured provider
make test           # go test ./...
make vet            # go vet ./...
```

### Repair a broken `~/.strike`

If config or sidecar JSON under `~/.strike` is missing or corrupted (startup
fails with a JSON parse error, or directories were deleted), run:

```sh
strike restore              # ~/.strike only
strike restore --project    # also ./.strike in the current directory
# no binary yet:
bash scripts/restore.sh
make restore
```

Valid files are never overwritten. Corrupt JSON is moved to
`<name>.corrupt-<timestamp>`; required `config` is rewritten with safe
defaults. Session logs, memory, issues, goals, history, and valid
`auth.json` credentials are left intact. After a quarantined `auth.json`,
re-run `strike auth login …`.

`make build` stamps:

```text
-X …/internal/version.Version=$(git describe --tags …)
-X …/internal/version.Commit=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
```

Release CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) builds linux/darwin amd64+arm64
tarballs and `checksums.txt` on `v*` tags.

## Launch

strike launches without any provider configured. Pick one inside the TUI
(`/provider`, `/model`, `/auth` — see [usage.md](/docs/usage)) or pass flags:

```sh
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…   # or: strike auth login anthropic
./strike                            # tries the config default silently;
                                    # otherwise select with /provider
./strike --provider <provider>       # anthropic, openai, xai, google, kimi, deepseek, or echo;
                                    # fails loudly if no credentials
./strike --model <model>             # pre-select a model
./strike --effort <level>            # off, low, medium, high, xhigh, or max
./strike --version                   # stamped semver + commit
./strike --upgrade                   # self-update from GitHub Releases
```

`--provider <provider>`, `--model <model>`, and `--effort <level>` may be
combined. To bypass permission checks for one invocation, use `--auto` or
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` (equivalent aliases).
**Warning:** this allows all tool calls without asks or denies. It applies
only to that process invocation, does not persist config or permission rules,
and is visibly marked as dangerous mode in the TUI. Run `strike --help` for
the authoritative CLI usage and option list.

Defaults when a provider is chosen without a model: `claude-sonnet-5`,
`gpt-5.5`, `grok-4.5`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, `moonshot-v1`, and `deepseek-chat`.

If you use the `strike` shell alias (points at this repo's built binary),
re-run `make build` after pulling changes to refresh it.

Credentials and provider login: [auth.md](/docs/auth).
