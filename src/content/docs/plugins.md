# Plugin bundle contract

Normative contract for **versioned plugin bundles** (epic
[#451](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/451), PLUGIN.1
[#725](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/725)).

A plugin is a **versioned contribution package** that reuses Strike's existing
extension surfaces (agents, skills, workflows, provider profiles, MCP,
harnesses, hooks, themes, and panes). It is **not** a new runtime, a
Node/Go host ABI, or a way to inject arbitrary provider code.

This document freezes identity, manifest shape, contribution matrix, trust,
path confinement, secrets, and schema-version rules **before** loaders land
([#726](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/726)+). Implementations
must not weaken these rules.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Contract (this doc)** | Normative. Loaders and CLI must conform. |
| **Passive load (#726)** | Discovery + load of agents, skills, workflows, themes, and provider profiles from enabled local plugin trees. |
| **Lifecycle CLI (#727)** | `strike plugin` install/list/inspect/enable/disable/remove/doctor for local + Git sources. |
| **Catalog / updates (#729)** | Remote `catalog.json`, search, catalog install, outdated, update with review; digest verify + zip-slip guards. |
| **TUI manager (#730)** | `/plugin` modal over `host.Plugins` (browse, install, trust, update, remove). |
| **Theme contributions (#511)** | Plugin themes load via `theme.Catalog`; `/theme` preview/apply/revert + provenance. |
| **Not implemented yet** | Pane host (#731) / web parity (#732). |
| **Out of scope forever (v1 model)** | In-process Go `plugin` packages, OpenCode-style Node plugin hosts, arbitrary provider/auth/streaming adapters, silent executable startup from an untrusted bundle. |

## 1. Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Plugin** | A directory tree with a root `plugin.json` (or `plugin.jsonc`) manifest plus contribution assets. |
| **Plugin ID** | Stable reverse-DNS or scoped slug identifying the package across installs (`acme.review-pack`). |
| **Bundle version** | Semver of the package contents (`1.2.0`), independent of Strike's release version. |
| **Schema version** | Integer `schemaVersion` of the manifest format (this contract starts at **1**). |
| **Source identity** | How the bundle was obtained: `local`, `git`, or `catalog` (see §6). |
| **Content digest** | Canonical SHA-256 over the package payload (see §5). |
| **Contribution** | One declared entry under `contributions` that maps onto an existing Strike loader. |
| **Passive** | Declarative assets loaded without starting a subprocess (agents, skills, workflows, themes, provider profiles). |
| **Executable** | Contributions that start a process or run shell (MCP stdio, harness commands, shell hooks). Require explicit trust (§5). |
| **Enablement** | User/project flag: disabled plugins contribute **nothing** on the next launch. |
| **Trust record** | Durable binding of `(plugin ID, source identity, content digest, capability set)` after explicit user review. |

## 2. Package layout

```text
<plugin-root>/
  plugin.json          # required manifest (JSON or JSONC)
  README.md            # optional human docs (not loaded as a contribution)
  agents/              # optional *.md agents
  skills/              # optional skills (name.md or name/SKILL.md)
  workflows/           # optional *.json workflows (schemaVersion 1)
  themes/              # optional theme JSON files
  providers/           # optional provider profile fragments
  mcp/                 # optional MCP server definitions (data only until trusted)
  harnesses/           # optional harness command definitions + binaries/scripts
  hooks/               # optional hook definition fragments
  panes/               # optional pane definitions (ABI: plugin-panes.md / #522)
  bin/                 # optional executables referenced by relative paths
  assets/              # optional non-code assets (icons, fixtures)
```

Rules:

1. **Root confinement.** All contribution paths in the manifest MUST resolve
   inside `<plugin-root>` after cleaning (`..`, symlinks that escape, absolute
   paths outside the root are rejected). Loaders fail closed with a diagnostic.
2. **No hidden roots.** Strike does not scan arbitrary repo paths for plugins.
   Install/discovery roots are only the configured global and project plugin
   directories (and lockfile-recorded installs) — see §4.
3. **Manifest is authoritative.** Undeclared files under the tree are ignored
   for loading (they may still affect the content digest if included in the
   digest set — see §5.2).
4. **No credentials in the tree.** Auth material, API keys, tokens, and
   private key material MUST NOT ship inside a plugin bundle. Use secret refs
   and the auth store ([secrets.md](/docs/secrets), [auth.md](/docs/auth)).

### Install roots (passive load #726 / lifecycle #727)

| Scope | Directory | Precedence |
|---|---|---|
| Global | `~/.strike/plugins/<plugin-id>/` | lower |
| Project | `./.strike/plugins/<plugin-id>/` | higher |

Lockfile: `~/.strike/plugins.lock.json` and/or `./.strike/plugins.lock.json`.
Passive load (#726) honors per-plugin `enabled` (default **true** when absent).
Lifecycle commands (#727) record source identity, pinned version, content digest,
and enablement — **never** credentials.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "plugins": {
    "acme.review-pack": {
      "enabled": true,
      "version": "1.2.0",
      "digest": "sha256:…",
      "installedAt": "2026-08-06T12:00:00Z",
      "source": {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/acme/review-pack.git",
        "ref": "main",
        "commit": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Local source identity uses `"type":"local"` and `"path"` (absolute path supplied
at install time). Git installs **must** pin `commit` (full SHA); mutable branches
are never followed silently on later launches. Catalog installs use
`"type":"catalog"` with `registry`, `package`, `version`, artifact `url`, and
artifact `digest` (see §6.3). Optional lockfile `trust` is cleared when an update
changes digest, source identity, or executable contributions (#728/#729).

### Lifecycle CLI (`strike plugin`, #727 / #729)

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `install <path\|git-url\|catalog:pkg[@ver]>` | Validate, copy/clone/download into scope root, write lockfile. Atomic: failed validation leaves no partially enabled plugin. |
| `search <query> --registry <url>` | Search a remote catalog index. |
| `outdated [--registry]` | List catalog-sourced installs with a newer published version. |
| `update <id> --yes` | Show contribution/capability review, then install newer catalog version (rollback-safe). |
| `list` / `inspect <id>` | Show installed plugins (including disabled) with scope, digest, source, trust state. |
| `enable` / `disable <id>` | Toggle lockfile `enabled`. Disable **preserves** source files; disabled plugins contribute nothing (passive or executable) on next launch. |
| `trust <id>` | Record executable trust for the current content digest + source identity + capability set. Required before MCP/harness/shell-hook activation. |
| `untrust <id>` | Remove the trust grant; executables stay inactive on next launch. Passive load is unaffected. |

| `remove <id> --yes` | Delete install directory and lockfile entry (confirmation required). |
| `doctor [id]` | Paths, provenance, contribution summary, collisions, trust state (`none` / `trusted` / `stale` / `n/a-passive-only`). Never prints secrets or MCP/harness env values (keys only). |

Flags: `--scope global|project` (install defaults to global), git `--ref` /
`--commit` / `--subdir`, catalog `--registry` / `--version`, install `--force`
to replace. Project scope uses the process working directory's `./.strike`.
Install destinations cannot escape the configured plugins roots. Lockfile
updates use an exclusive advisory lock plus atomic rename so concurrent
lifecycle ops are safe. Updates are never unattended (`--yes` required after
review).

Drop a validated bundle under a plugins root manually if needed (directory name
need not match `id`; the manifest `id` is authoritative). Restart Strike to pick
up changes (hot reload is a non-goal).

---

## 3. Normative manifest (`schemaVersion: 1`)

### 3.1 Top-level fields

| Field | Required | Type | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | yes | integer | Must be `1` for this contract. See §8. |
| `id` | yes | string | Plugin ID: `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*(\.[a-z][a-z0-9-]*)+$` **or** single-segment `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,63}$`. Max 128 chars. Immutable for the life of the package identity. |
| `version` | yes | string | Semver 2.0 (`1.0.0`, optional pre-release). Bundle version. |
| `name` | yes | string | Human display name (1–80 chars). |
| `description` | no | string | Short summary (≤500 chars). |
| `strike` | yes | object | Compatibility range for the Strike binary. |
| `strike.min` | yes | string | Minimum Strike semver (inclusive), e.g. `"0.2.0"`. |
| `strike.max` | no | string | Optional exclusive upper bound. |
| `source` | no | object | Author-declared default source hint; **install lockfile overrides** at runtime. |
| `contributions` | yes | object | Map of contribution-type → entries. At least one non-empty list/map required. |
| `capabilities` | no | string[] | Declared capability tags for update review (§6.4). |
| `digest` | no | string | Author-published expected content digest (`sha256:<hex>`). Installers verify when present; loaders recompute. |

Unknown top-level fields: **rejected** on strict decode (same posture as
workflows). Optional `$schema` key is ignored (editor only), matching config.

Executable entries **must not** start until trust is recorded (§5). Passive
entries from an enabled plugin may load without that trust record
([#726](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/726)); executable
activation is [#728](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/728).

---

## 4. Discovery, precedence, namespacing, collisions, enablement

### 4.1 Discovery order

Deterministic merge order for **enabled** plugins (later wins where noted):

1. Built-in Strike surfaces (not plugins).
2. Global non-plugin roots (`~/.strike/agents`, skills, workflows, themes, …).
3. **Global plugins** — enabled entries under `~/.strike/plugins/`, ordered by
   plugin ID ascending for stability, then contribution path ascending.
4. Project non-plugin roots (`./.strike/agents`, …).
5. **Project plugins** — enabled entries under `./.strike/plugins/`, same
   sort.
6. Managed/MDM policy still applies as a ceiling on security dials
   ([config.md](/docs/config#managed-mdm-config-enterprise)); plugins cannot
   weaken managed denies.

Peer import trees (`.claude`, `.opencode`) stay **outside** the plugin system;
they continue to use existing discovery ([agents-skills.md](/docs/multi-agent)).

### 4.2 Enablement

- Default for a newly installed plugin: **enabled for passive** contributions
  only after successful manifest validation; **executable contributions stay
  inactive** until explicit trust (§5).
- Disablement is sticky in the lockfile/config: a disabled plugin contributes
  **nothing** (passive or executable) on the next launch.
- Hot reload is a non-goal for wave 1–2; changes apply on process restart
  (or an explicit reload command if added later without changing this contract).

### 4.3 Namespacing

| Surface | Public name rule |
|---|---|
| Agents, skills, workflows, themes | Contribution keeps its **own** declared name (frontmatter / JSON `id` / filename). Plugin ID is attached as **provenance** in diagnostics, not forced into the user-visible name. |
| MCP servers | `contributions.mcp[].name` is the server slug (`mcp_<name>_…` tools). Must match existing MCP slug rules: `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_-]*$`. |
| Harnesses | `contributions.harnesses[].name` is the harness registry name referenced from agent frontmatter. |
| Provider profiles | `profileName` (or object key) is the provider name in `/provider`. |
| Panes | `contributions.panes[].id` — unique across enabled plugins; ABI in [plugin-panes.md](/docs/plugin-panes). |

Diagnostics and `/context`-style provenance SHOULD show
`plugin=<id>@<version> source=<…> path=<rel>`.

### 4.4 Collisions

| Case | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Same plugin ID in global and project | **Project wins** entirely (project install shadows global for that ID). |
| Two different plugin IDs contribute the same agent/skill/workflow/theme name | **Higher precedence source wins** (§4.1). Loser is skipped with an explicit diagnostic (not silent). |
| Two plugins contribute the same MCP server name or harness name | **Fail closed** for the colliding executable contribution; emit diagnostic. Do not merge commands. |
| Plugin contribution vs non-plugin project file same name | Non-plugin project root wins over global plugins; project plugins win over project non-plugin only when the plugin layer is higher in §4.1 (project plugins are highest user layer). |
| Duplicate paths inside one manifest | Reject manifest. |
| Malformed plugin | Skip that plugin; **must not** shadow another source silently ([#726](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/726) AC). |

---

## 5. Trust model

### 5.1 Trust classes

| Class | Applies to | Startup / invoke |
|---|---|---|
| **Passive** | agents, skills, workflows, themes, provider profiles, **static panes** (`mode: static`) | Load when plugin enabled + manifest valid + Strike version OK. No subprocess. |
| **Executable** | MCP (stdio command), harnesses, shell hooks (`type: command`), **process panes** (`mode: process`) | **Blocked** until a trust record matches current source identity + content digest + capability set. |
| **Networked config** | MCP `transport: http` | Treated as executable-class for trust (may send headers/secrets to a URL) even without a local binary. |

Stock config paths (`~/.strike/mcp.jsonc`, config `hooks`, config `harnesses`)
remain as today: project-local commands are trusted like other local scripts
the user edited. **Plugin-sourced** executables are stricter: no silent
startup from a git clone or catalog install.

### 5.2 Content digest

- Algorithm: **SHA-256**, encoded `sha256:` + lowercase hex.
- **Canonical payload:** sorted list of all regular files under `<plugin-root>`
  except:
  - VCS metadata (`.git/**`)
  - editor junk (`.DS_Store`, `*.swp`)
  - optional local override files explicitly listed in lockfile as
    non-payload (none in v1 by default)
- For each file: length + path relative to root (slash-separated, no leading
  `./`) + raw bytes. Symlinks: digest the referent **only if** it stays inside
  the root; otherwise reject the package.
- Manifest field `digest`, when present, must equal the computed digest or
  install/load fails.
- Lockfile stores the digest that was reviewed.

### 5.3 Trust record binding

A trust grant is valid only when **all** match:

1. Plugin `id`
2. Source identity (§6) — e.g. git URL + resolved commit, or catalog slug +
   version, or absolute local path identity
3. Content digest
4. Capability set actually granted (subset of declared `capabilities` /
   inferred executable kinds)

### 5.4 Invalidation

Trust is **invalidated** (executable contributions stop; user must re-review)
when any of the following change:

- Content digest (any payload file change)
- Source identity (different remote, commit, catalog version, or local path
  replacement)
- New or changed executable contribution entries (command, args, env keys,
  hook command, MCP URL/headers keys, process-pane command/args/env)
- `schemaVersion` increase that the running Strike does not implement
- Plugin `version` change that alters executable capability tags

Passive-only file edits that change the digest still invalidate executable
trust (fail closed): reviewers re-confirm the whole package. Implementation
MAY present a diff of capability/executable changes to speed review
([#729](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/729)).

### 5.5 Explicit exclusions (normative)

Implementations MUST NOT:

1. Load **in-process Go plugins** (`plugin.Open`) or dlopen-style native
   modules from bundles.
2. Host **Node/TypeScript plugin APIs** (OpenCode plugin runtime) — see
   [peer-ecosystem.md](/docs/peer-ecosystem).
3. Allow provider contributions to register **arbitrary wire/auth/streaming
   code** — only profiles for **shipped** adapters (§7.5).
4. **Auto-start** MCP/harness/hook executables from a plugin without a matching
   trust record.
5. Treat catalog metadata alone as trust (metadata cannot enable execution).

---

## 6. Source identities

### 6.1 `local`

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `type` | `local` |
| `path` | Absolute path to plugin root after install copy, or user-supplied path |

Install copies or links into the scope root; runtime identity is the installed
path + digest. Path must stay under the configured plugins root (no escape).

### 6.2 `git`

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `type` | `git` |
| `url` | HTTPS or SSH git URL |
| `ref` | Optional branch/tag name used at resolve time |
| `commit` | **Required** pinned full commit SHA after install |
| `subdir` | Optional subdirectory inside the repo |

Mutable branches MUST NOT be followed silently on update — pin `commit`
([#727](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/727)). Digest is of the
checked-out plugin subtree.

### 6.3 `catalog`

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `type` | `catalog` |
| `registry` | Catalog base identity (URL) |
| `package` | Package slug in the catalog (matches plugin `id`) |
| `version` | Immutable published version |
| `url` | Artifact URL (`.tar.gz` or `.zip`) |
| `digest` | Expected **artifact** digest (`sha256:<hex>`) from catalog metadata |

Lockfile `digest` (entry-level) remains the **content-tree** digest after extract.
Both are recorded so an install is reproducible.

#### Remote catalog format (`schemaVersion: 1`)

Index URL: `<registry>/catalog.json` when `registry` is a base directory, or a
direct `.json` URL. Strict JSON; unknown fields rejected. Metadata **cannot**
enable plugins or grant trust.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "registry": "https://example.com/strike-plugins",
  "packages": [
    {
      "id": "acme.review-pack",
      "name": "Acme Review Pack",
      "description": "…",
      "versions": [
        {
          "version": "1.2.0",
          "url": "https://cdn.example.com/acme.review-pack-1.2.0.tar.gz",
          "digest": "sha256:…",
          "contentDigest": "sha256:…",
          "capabilities": ["agents", "skills", "mcp.stdio"],
          "strike": { "min": "0.2.0" },
          "manifestSchema": 1,
          "size": 12345
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Rules |
|---|---|
| `digest` | **Required.** SHA-256 of artifact bytes; install fails on mismatch. |
| `contentDigest` | Optional. Must match `ComputeDigest` of extracted tree when set. |
| `signature` | Reserved; v1 verifies digests only. Presence does not grant trust. |
| `size` | Optional upper bound on artifact bytes (also globally capped). |

Transport: HTTP(S) only, bounded body sizes, limited redirects. Extraction
rejects absolute paths, `..`, symlinks, and oversized payloads (zip-slip / tar
traversal fail closed).

CLI: `strike plugin search`, `install catalog:pkg[@ver] --registry`, `outdated`,
`update --yes` (`internal/plugin` catalog client).

### 6.4 Update capability review

Before accepting an update (git pull to new commit, catalog newer version, or
local replace), the lifecycle UX MUST show:

- Old → new `version` and content digest
- Added/removed/changed contribution types
- Executable command/args/env/URL diffs (env/header **keys** only — never values)
- Capability tag diffs (`capabilities` and inferred executable kinds)

User confirmation (`--yes`) applies the update. Prior trust is **invalidated**
when digest, source identity, or executable contributions change (lockfile
`trust` cleared). The previous working version remains until the update commits
atomically; failed download, verification, validation, or activation rolls back
([#727](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/727),
[#729](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/729)).
No automatic unattended updates.

## 7. Contribution matrix

For each type: validation, naming, precedence, lifecycle, trust.

### 7.1 Agents (`contributions.agents`)

| Axis | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Entry** | `{ "path": "<rel .md>" }` |
| **Validation** | Existing agent markdown loader rules for Strike-native trees (fail closed on invalid names/effort/permissions). Path must be `.md` under the plugin root. |
| **Naming** | Agent name from frontmatter/`filename`; uniqueness per §4.4. |
| **Precedence** | §4.1; same-name override with diagnostic on the loser. |
| **Lifecycle** | Loaded at session start when plugin enabled; unavailable when disabled. No process. |
| **Trust** | Passive. |

### 7.2 Skills (`contributions.skills`)

| Axis | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Entry** | `{ "path": "<rel>" }` — file `name.md` or `name/SKILL.md`. |
| **Validation** | Existing skill loader; markdown only — no JS/TS execution. |
| **Naming** | Skill invoke name from frontmatter or directory name. |
| **Precedence** | §4.1. |
| **Lifecycle** | Catalog at start; `/skill` and skill tool see enabled plugins only. |
| **Trust** | Passive. |

### 7.3 Workflows (`contributions.workflows`)

| Axis | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Entry** | `{ "path": "<rel .json>" }` |
| **Validation** | Workflow schema v1 strict decode + structural validate ([agents-skills.md](/docs/multi-agent#workflows)). |
| **Naming** | Workflow `name` field; source provenance `plugin`. |
| **Precedence** | §4.1; project non-plugin and project plugin layers as specified. |
| **Lifecycle** | Listed in catalog; activation remains a separate user/tool step (scaffold never activates). |
| **Trust** | Passive. Phase permission widening still requires existing approval UX. |

### 7.4 Themes (`contributions.themes`)

| Axis | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Entry** | `{ "path": "<rel .json>" }` |
| **Validation** | Existing theme JSON schema ([theme.md](/docs/theme)). |
| **Naming** | Theme `id` inside file. |
| **Precedence** | §4.1 (after bundled, before or with user theme dirs as loaders specify — plugin project > plugin global). |
| **Lifecycle** | Available to `/theme` when enabled. |
| **Trust** | Passive. Packaging tracked further in [#511](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/511). |

### 7.5 Provider profiles (`contributions.providers`)

| Axis | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Entry** | `{ "path": "<rel>", "profileName": "<name>" }` or a single-profile JSON object file. |
| **Validation** | Same shape as `providers.jsonc` custom/overlay entries ([config.md](/docs/config#custom-providers)). |
| **Naming** | `profileName` / object key. |
| **Precedence** | §4.1; cannot override managed policy. |
| **Lifecycle** | Merged into provider catalog when enabled. |
| **Trust** | Passive **configuration only**. |
| **Hard limit** | Profiles may target **shipped wire adapters only** (openai-compatible, anthropic-compatible, and built-in ids). Fields like `npm` are hints only and are **never** loaded as code. No bundle may register new Go provider implementations, OAuth handlers, or streaming parsers. Credentials stay in env refs / auth store — never in plugin files. |

### 7.6 MCP (`contributions.mcp`)

| Axis | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Entry** | `{ "name", "transport", "command"?, "args"?, "env"?, "url"?, "headers"? }` aligned with [config.md](/docs/mcp). Relative `command` resolves inside plugin root (`bin/…`). |
| **Validation** | Existing MCP server field rules; path confinement on command; env/header **values** must be secret refs or non-secret literals — never print values in doctor/UI. |
| **Naming** | Server `name` slug; tools `mcp_<name>_<tool>`. |
| **Precedence** | Name collision fail closed (§4.4). User `mcp.jsonc` entries are a separate source; document winner in loader diagnostics (recommended: explicit user config overrides plugin on same name). |
| **Lifecycle** | Registered only when plugin enabled **and** trusted (#728). Start with session like config MCP; disablement stops process and unregisters tools. |
| **Trust** | **Executable** (stdio and http). |

### 7.7 Harnesses (`contributions.harnesses`)

| Axis | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Entry** | `{ "name", "command", "args"? }` — external process only ([harnesses.md](/docs/harnesses)). |
| **Validation** | Command path confinement; no embedded Go harness registration from plugins. |
| **Naming** | Harness registry name; agent frontmatter `harness: <name>`. |
| **Precedence** | Name collision fail closed. |
| **Lifecycle** | Available to `task` children when trusted; root turns never invoke harnesses (existing engine rule). |
| **Trust** | **Executable**. Still unsandboxed process isolation model as today — trust review is mandatory because of that. |

### 7.8 Hooks (`contributions.hooks`)

| Axis | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Entry** | Same fields as config `hooks[]` ([config.md](/docs/config), [peer-ecosystem.md](/docs/peer-ecosystem#hooks-alignment)): `event`, `matcher`, `type`, `command` / declarative fields. |
| **Validation** | Existing hook schema; `command` path confinement when `type` is command/shell. |
| **Naming** | No global name; identity is plugin id + index/path for diagnostics. |
| **Precedence** | Concatenate like global-then-project hooks: after user global, plugin global, user project, plugin project (exact order fixed in #728 to match §4.1). |
| **Lifecycle** | Matched at runtime only if plugin enabled + trusted for command hooks. Declarative-only hooks follow passive load rules but still require plugin enablement. |
| **Trust** | Command/shell hooks: **executable**. Pure declarative hooks: passive. |

### 7.9 Panes (`contributions.panes`)

Normative pane ABI: **[plugin-panes.md](/docs/plugin-panes)** (PLUGIN.8 / #522).
Summary only — do not contradict that document.

| Axis | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Entry** | `{ "id", "path", "abi": "pane/1" }`. `path` is a pane definition JSON/JSONC under the plugin root. Legacy `"abi": "reserved"` is not valid once pane loaders land. |
| **Validation** | Definition `schemaVersion` 1; `mode` is `static` or `process`; path confinement; permissions default-deny ([plugin-panes.md](/docs/plugin-panes#8-permissions)). Unknown definition fields rejected. |
| **Naming** | Pane `id` unique across enabled plugins; fail closed on collision. Built-in window ids are reserved and must not be claimed. |
| **Precedence** | §4.1 for discovery; pane id collision fail closed (like MCP/harness names). Layout group placement is host UX ([#731](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/731)). |
| **Lifecycle** | Descriptors register when the plugin is enabled (and trusted for process mode). Mount/focus starts static binding or process supervision; disable/remove tears down. Hosts: [#731](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/731) TUI, [#732](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/732) web. |
| **Trust** | `mode: static` with `fs/network/command: none` → **passive**. `mode: process` → **executable** (`panes.process` capability). Never exposes the private Go `window` interface or in-process TUI/Go plugins; render trees are bounded primitives only. |

## 8. Schema version compatibility

| Running Strike \ Manifest | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Implements `schemaVersion` **N**, manifest `N` | Load normally. |
| Implements max **N**, manifest `M` where `M < N` | Load if Strike still supports `M` (v1 support remains until a future major deprecation). |
| Manifest `M` where `M >` Strike max | **Skip plugin** with explicit diagnostic: upgrade Strike. Do not partial-load. |
| Missing `schemaVersion` | Reject manifest. |
| Unknown fields at version N | Reject (strict). Future N+1 may add fields only with a version bump. |
| Removing/renaming fields | Only in a new `schemaVersion` with a documented migration. |

**Forward compatibility for catalogs:** registries MAY list multiple
artifacts per plugin version for different schema versions; clients pick the
highest schema they implement.

**Backward compatibility promise:** schemaVersion 1 remains readable by all
Strike releases that advertise plugin support until a future major release
announces removal in CHANGELOG **Upgrade note**.

---

## 9. Path confinement (normative)

1. Reject contribution paths that are absolute or contain `..` segments after
   cleaning.
2. After `filepath.EvalSymlinks` (or equivalent), the resolved path MUST have
   the plugin root as prefix.
3. `command` fields: if relative, resolve under plugin root; if absolute, allow
   only when the trust review UI showed the absolute path and the path is not
   rewritten by the plugin after trust (digest covers scripts; absolute system
   binaries are part of the reviewed entry text).
4. Archive extraction (catalog installs) MUST guard against zip-slip / tar
   traversal ([#729](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/729)).
5. Plugin roots themselves MUST live under `~/.strike/plugins` or
   `./.strike/plugins` (or test overrides via env used only in tests).

---

## 10. Secret handling (normative)

1. **No secrets in bundles** — keys, tokens, PEMs, `.env` files with
   credentials.
2. MCP `env` / `headers` and similar fields SHOULD use
   `secret://env/NAME` or `{env:NAME}` forms ([secrets.md](/docs/secrets));
   resolve only at process start, never into model-visible output or doctor
   text.
3. Doctor / plugin inspect / logs print **ref names and redacted placeholders**,
   never resolved values ([#727](https://github.com/jonathanung/strike/issues/727)).
4. Session JSONL and exports continue to run through `secret.RedactEvent` /
   `pkg/redact`; plugin provenance metadata is non-secret.
5. Trust records and lockfiles store digests and source identity, not env
   contents.

## 11. Lifecycle summary (implementation map)

| Stage | Issue | Contract touchpoints |
|---|---|---|
| Contract | #725 (this doc) | Manifest, matrix, trust, schema |
| Passive load | #726 (`internal/plugin` + config/theme wiring) | §3–4, §7.1–7.5, §8–10 |
| Local/Git CLI | #727 | §2, §6.1–6.2, enablement, doctor |
| Executable activation | #728 (`trust`/`untrust`, `CompileExecutables`, assemble wiring) | §5, §7.6–7.8 |
| Catalog / updates | #729 (`internal/plugin` catalog/archive + CLI) | §6.3–6.4, digest verify |
| TUI manager | #730 (`/plugin` modal + `host.Plugins`) | UX over enablement + trust |
| Themes packaging | #511 (`theme.Catalog` + `/theme` preview) | §7.4 |
| Pane ABI | #522 | §7.9 + [plugin-panes.md](/docs/plugin-panes) |
| Pane host / web | #731 #732 | implement [plugin-panes.md](/docs/plugin-panes); no TUI type leakage to web |

## 12. Non-goals (restated)

- Automatic unattended updates (catalog update requires explicit `--yes`).
- Paid marketplace infrastructure.
- A generic arbitrary-code plugin ABI or in-process extension mechanism.
- Hot reload of plugin trees.
- Replacing stock `mcp.jsonc` / config hooks / harnesses (plugins are additive
  packages with stronger trust for executables).

## 13. Acceptance mapping (#725)

| AC | Section |
|---|---|
| Normative manifest + passive and executable examples | §3 |
| Every contribution type: validation, naming, precedence, lifecycle, trust | §7 |
| Trust binds to source + content digest; invalidation on relevant changes | §5 |
| Path confinement + secret-handling explicit | §9, §10 |
| Forward/backward schema-version behavior | §8 |

## 14. Acceptance mapping (#726)

| AC | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Valid fixtures appear on agent/skill/workflow/theme/provider surfaces | `internal/plugin.Discover` + `config` loaders + `theme.Catalog` |
| Unsupported versions, duplicates, traversal, malformed, collisions → diagnostics | `Diagnostic` codes: `schema_version`, `strike_version`, `duplicate_id`, `path`, `malformed`, `collision`, `digest` |
| Malformed plugin cannot silently shadow | Skip plugin; other sources unchanged |
| Disabled plugins contribute nothing | `plugins.lock.json` `enabled: false` |
| No arbitrary provider/auth/streaming code | Provider profiles via `ParseProvidersFile` / shipped `WireAPI` only; secret literals rejected |
| Tests: precedence, namespacing, disablement, path confinement | `internal/plugin/*_test.go`, `internal/config/plugins_test.go`, theme catalog tests |

## 15. Acceptance mapping (#727)

| AC | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Install atomic; failed validation leaves nothing enabled | `plugin.Install` stages under plugins root, validates, then rename + lockfile under flock; rollback on lock write failure |
| Git installs pinned (no silent mutable branch follow) | Lockfile `source.commit` full SHA; `ref` stored only as resolve hint |
| Disable preserves files; remove confirms + updates lockfile | `Disable` / `Remove` (`--yes`) |
| Doctor exact paths; no secrets or env values | `plugin.Doctor` + `FormatDoctorText`; env/header **keys** only; `pkg/redact` on URLs |
| Project/global scopes explicit; no root escape | `--scope`; `Roots.ConfinePath` |
| Safe under concurrent lockfile writes | `WithLockfileLock` (flock) + atomic rename |
| CLI | `strike plugin list\|inspect\|install\|enable\|disable\|remove\|doctor` |

## 16. Acceptance mapping (#729)

| AC | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Remote installs pin immutable version + verified digest | `SourceIdentity` catalog fields + artifact `sha256` check before extract; lockfile pins version/URL/digests |
| Catalog metadata cannot silently enable or execute | No trust from catalog; install sets `enabled` for passive only; `trust` never set from metadata; unknown catalog fields rejected |
| Updates changing executable content invalidate prior trust | `BuildUpdateReview` + lockfile `trust` cleared on digest/source/executable change |
| Failed download/verify/validate/activation preserves prior | Stage under plugins root; validate before rename; backup restore on failure |
| Lockfile provenance enough to reproduce | `registry`, `package`, `version`, artifact `url`/`digest`, content `digest` |
| Network + archive paths bounded; traversal tested | `downloadBytes` caps; `sanitizeArchivePath` / zip-slip tests in `catalog_test.go` |
| Search / install / outdated / update CLI | `strike plugin search\|install catalog:…\|outdated\|update` |
