description: Own a GitHub issue end-to-end in strike-cli-web — worktree, implement, validate, PR, spawn review agents that comment on the PR, address feedback in a loop, CI, merge. Use when asked to handle/fix/close an issue, ship a PR from an issue, or babysit issue work through merge to main.

# Issue handler (strike-cli-web)

Own the issue end-to-end with due diligence on research, validation, and shipping. Shipping is ownership: commit → push → PR → **review-agent loop** → CI green → merge → cleanup. All code edits happen inside a **git worktree**, never the primary checkout.

This skill is for the **strike-cli-web** marketing/info site (React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind), not the strike-cli Go product. Apply when the user frames work as an issue (or asks you to own issue→main).

## Preconditions

- `gh auth status` ok; git repo; network; issue number/URL known.
- **Stop-and-ask:** no write access; `gh` missing; issue already has an open PR you did not create (attach or ask — no duplicate). Dirty primary is fine for `git worktree add` from `origin/main` — do not clean/stash primary WIP.

## Workflow

0. **Orient** — `gh issue view N` (+ comments). Read `AGENTS.md` + `README.md` for scope and how the site is built/deployed. (No `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is required in this repo.)
1. **Research** — map issue → surfaces under `src/components/`, `src/components/ui/`, `src/index.css`, `src/lib/`, `public/`, and when relevant `nginx.conf`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`. Read neighboring components and tokens. Optional local `.plan/` notes **if present** (never block if missing). State acceptance criteria bullets. Stop-and-ask if ambiguous.
2. **Worktree** — create/enter; confirm `pwd` + branch before edits.
3. **Plan** — smallest correct change; no drive-by refactors.
4. **Implement** — worktree only; load sibling skills when domain matches (`web-components` for UI; keep install string single-sourced).
5. **Validate** — load `test-and-validate`; run CI-equivalent gates; use that skill’s report format.
6. **Ship** — commit, push `origin/<branch>`, PR with `Fixes #N`.
7. **Review loop** — spawn review agent(s); post findings as PR review comments; address them; re-review until merge-ready (see below).
8. **Babysit CI** — fix branch-related failures; re-push; re-enter review loop after material code changes.
9. **Merge** — only when merge gates pass (below).
10. **Cleanup** — remove worktree after merge; leave cwd outside deleted tree.

## Worktree setup

```sh
MAIN_ROOT=$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")
WT_PARENT="$(dirname "$MAIN_ROOT")/strike-cli-web-worktrees"
BRANCH="worktree-<slug>"   # e.g. worktree-12-hero-copy; 2–4 kebab words; include issue # if helpful
mkdir -p "$WT_PARENT"
git fetch origin main
# Resume if yours; else create. Never delete others' worktrees.
if [ -d "$WT_PARENT/$BRANCH" ] && git worktree list | grep -q "$WT_PARENT/$BRANCH"; then
  # On $BRANCH and yours (clean or only your WIP): cd and continue.
  # Stop-and-ask: foreign worktree, unexpected dirty state you don't own, or ambiguous collision.
  cd "$WT_PARENT/$BRANCH"
else
  git worktree add -b "$BRANCH" "$WT_PARENT/$BRANCH" origin/main
  cd "$WT_PARENT/$BRANCH"
fi
```

Before every edit session:

```sh
pwd   # must be $WT_PARENT/$BRANCH
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD   # must be $BRANCH
```

Refuse Write/Edit under primary checkout for issue implementation.

## Local verification

CI-equivalent — **always** before push (not softer than CI build job):

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm run test --if-present
npm run lint --if-present
```

**Docker / install proxy** when the change touches `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `nginx.conf`, or install URL/proxy behavior:

```sh
docker compose up --build -d
# smoke homepage and /install (proxy must return script body, not a redirect page)
curl -fsS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8080/
curl -fsSL http://localhost:8080/install | head -n 20
docker compose down
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` **build** job): Node 22, `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `test`/`lint` if-present. Deploy job is **main push only** — handlers validate build; they do not deploy from the laptop.

Load `test-and-validate` for report format. Never weaken or delete checks solely to go green. If you add a test or lint script, it must pass.

## Commit and push

```sh
git status && git diff && git log --oneline -10
git add <intended paths only>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): concise summary

Fixes #<N>
EOF
)"
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Conventional commits: `feat`/`fix`/`docs`/`refactor`/`test`/`chore`. No secrets. No force-push main. No hook skips. Prefer new commits over amend/force on shared PR branch.

## Open PR

```sh
gh pr create --base main --head "$BRANCH" --title "type(scope): summary" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- …

## Issue
Fixes #<N>

## Verification
- npm ci; npm run build; npm run test --if-present; npm run lint --if-present
- (if infra) docker compose smoke + /install proxy check
EOF
)"
```

Focused PR; no AI wall of text. If PR exists: `gh pr view`.

## Review-agent loop (required)

After the PR exists, **do not merge until this loop completes**. You (the issue handler) own dispatching reviewers, posting their findings on the PR, fixing code, and repeating.

### When to run

- Once after first push + PR open (may run in parallel with CI).
- Again after **any** push that changes production, skills, workflow, nginx/Docker, or other merge-bound files — including review/CI fixes.
- Skip re-review only for pure changelog typos that cannot affect behavior or process — when unsure, re-review.
- A clean review on an **older** SHA does **not** satisfy merge gates after a new push.

### Resolve PR identity (use these vars in recipes)

```sh
PR=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)   # owner/name
```

### Spawn reviewers

**Preferred:** dispatch a read-only reviewer subagent:

- Task `subagent_type: reviewer` when the host provides it, **or**
- **In-process fallback:** you (the issue handler) run the same rubric yourself

Do **not** require a missing in-repo agent file. If Task/reviewer is unavailable, still load the diff, still post findings via `gh`. Never skip the loop.

Optionally spawn a second pass focused on a11y, install/CTA correctness, or deploy/nginx if the first pass is large or the change touches those surfaces.

Reviewer prompt **must** include:

- PR number/URL, base branch (`main`), and current `headRefOid`
- Issue number and acceptance criteria
- Hard requirement: run `gh pr diff $PR` (or receive the full patch) and read surrounding components/tokens/config before any verdict — **never** approve from title/URL alone
- Instruction: correctness bugs first (concrete failure scenario), then needless complexity / missed reuse; no impact-free style nits
- Instruction: return ranked findings with `path:line`, severity `blocking` | `should-fix` | `nit`, failure scenario, and the **head SHA actually reviewed**
- Instruction: do **not** edit files; findings only; output must be paste-ready verbatim
- Context: this is a React/Vite marketing site — paths are typically `.tsx`, `.css`, `.yml`, `nginx.conf`, not Go packages

Also pull human/GitHub review state:

```sh
gh pr view "$PR" --json reviews,comments,reviewDecision,headRefOid
gh api "repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/comments"
gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/$PR/comments"
```

### Post findings as PR review comments

Post reviewer output on the PR (not only chat). **Post the reviewer’s ranked findings verbatim** — do not omit, soften, or downgrade severity. If you disagree with a blocking/should-fix item, still post it and **stop-and-ask** (or reply on the thread with the dispute); silent drop is forbidden.

**Event policy (handler is usually the PR author):**

- Automated/handler-authored reviews **always** use `"event": "COMMENT"` (never `REQUEST_CHANGES` or `APPROVE` — GitHub rejects self-approve and self-request-changes leaves merge gates stuck).
- Encode severity in the review body and inline comment text (`**blocking:**`, `**should-fix:**`, `**nit:**`).
- Reserve GitHub `APPROVE` / `REQUEST_CHANGES` for **distinct human** reviewers only.

**Preferred — single COMMENT review with inline notes** (only for lines in the PR diff hunk on `$HEAD_SHA`):

```sh
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view "$PR" --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)
# Build JSON from reviewer findings (verbatim). Example shape:
gh api "repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/reviews" --method POST --input - <<EOF
{
  "commit_id": "$HEAD_SHA",
  "event": "COMMENT",
  "body": "Review pass N on $HEAD_SHA\n\n(verbatim summary of blocking / should-fix / nits)",
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "src/components/Hero.tsx",
      "line": 42,
      "side": "RIGHT",
      "body": "**blocking:** …\n\nFailure scenario: …"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

If an inline `line` is not part of the diff hunk, the API 422s — put that finding in the top-level review body instead (do not invent lines).

**Fallback — top-level PR comment** when inline mapping is impractical (preferred for long verbatim bodies; avoids JSON escaping issues):

```sh
gh pr comment "$PR" --body "$(cat <<EOF
## Review pass N (head \`$HEAD_SHA\`)
### Blocking
- \`src/components/InstallCommand.tsx:12\` — … (failure scenario)

### Should-fix
- \`src/index.css:4\` — …

### Nits (optional)
- …
EOF
)"
```

**Clean pass (0 blocking, 0 should-fix) — still required on the PR:**

A chat-only “LGTM” does **not** count. Always record the clean pass against `$HEAD_SHA`:

```sh
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view "$PR" --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)
gh pr comment "$PR" --body "$(cat <<EOF
## Review pass N (head \`$HEAD_SHA\`) — clean
0 blocking, 0 should-fix. Merge checklist may proceed for this SHA only.
EOF
)"
# Or: gh api reviews with event COMMENT, commit_id=$HEAD_SHA, empty comments array.
```

When building `gh api` JSON for inline reviews, encode bodies with `jq -n --arg body "$text"` (or similar) so quotes/newlines in verbatim findings do not break the payload. If encoding is painful, use the `gh pr comment` path above.

Rules for posted comments:

- Include severity tag and failure scenario for blocking/should-fix.
- Anchor path:line to the diff on this PR’s current head SHA.
- Do not spam duplicates across passes — reply on the existing thread or mark resolved in the next summary with the new SHA.

### Address comments

1. List open review threads / new comments (human + automated).
2. For each **blocking** and **should-fix**: fix in the worktree; re-run local verification (`npm run build`, plus test/lint if-present, plus Docker when infra).
3. **Nits:** fix if cheap and clearly better; otherwise reply on the thread why deferred (one line).
4. Commit and push (new commit; no amend/force on shared PR branch).
5. Reply on each addressed thread (or in a single PR comment) with what changed (`commit` shortsha + brief note).
6. Re-run local gates; watch CI; **spawn another review pass on the new `headRefOid`**.

### Loop limits

- Continue until a review pass on the **current** `headRefOid` reports **no blocking and no should-fix**, CI is green on that SHA, and merge gates pass.
- Cap at **5** review passes. If **any** blocking or should-fix remains after 5, stop-and-ask with a summary (do not merge).
- Product/design ambiguity in a comment → stop-and-ask; do not guess.

### Merge-ready checklist (all required)

- [ ] Clean review pass (0 blocking, 0 should-fix) recorded against **current** `headRefOid` (posted review/`commit_id` or comment must cite that SHA)
- [ ] That SHA matches `gh pr view --json headRefOid` at merge time
- [ ] Reviewer findings from the latest pass were posted **verbatim** on the PR
- [ ] All actionable human review comments addressed or explicitly deferred with reason
- [ ] `reviewDecision` is not `CHANGES_REQUESTED` (human reviewers); do not use self-REQUEST_CHANGES
- [ ] CI checks green on the same head SHA (build job; deploy is not required on PR)
- [ ] `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, not draft, state `OPEN`
- [ ] Local CI-equivalent gates passed on the same commit

## CI watch / fix

gh-only (no Python watchers):

```sh
gh pr checks --watch
# or poll:
gh pr view --json state,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup,reviewDecision,isDraft
gh pr checks
gh run list --branch "$BRANCH" --limit 5
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

| Class | Action |
|---|---|
| Branch-related | fix in worktree → commit → push → re-watch → **re-enter review loop** |
| Flaky/infra | `gh run rerun <id> --failed` ≤2; then stop-and-ask |
| Ambiguous | one diagnosis; then stop-and-ask |
| Actionable review | fix → commit → push → **re-enter review loop** |

## Merge

Merge **only when** the merge-ready checklist above is fully satisfied:

```sh
gh pr merge --merge
```

`--merge` matches repo history. Do not pass `--delete-branch` while still checked out on the feature branch in the worktree (main is already checked out in the primary tree) — remote/local branch deletion happens in Cleanup after `git worktree remove`. Blocked on review/permissions → stop-and-ask; never force. **Hard forbids:** force-push; careless `reset --hard`; merge with failing checks; merge without a clean review pass; close/reopen PR unprompted.

Note: merging to `main` will trigger the workflow **deploy** job in GitHub Actions. That is expected for intentional merges; do not merge experimental work to main to “try deploy.”

## Cleanup (after merge)

From `MAIN_ROOT`:

```sh
cd "$MAIN_ROOT" && git fetch origin main
git worktree remove "$WT_PARENT/$BRANCH"
git branch -d "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true
git worktree prune
```

Do not leave cwd inside deleted worktree. Only delete branch you created.

## Sibling skills

| When | Load |
|---|---|
| Page sections, UI primitives, tokens, motion, demos, install CTA | `web-components` first |
| Before claiming done / after impl or CI-fix | `test-and-validate` |

No other domain skills are required for this repo.

## Hard rules

1. Own issue end-to-end through merge — including review-agent loop.
2. Never edit primary checkout for issue implementation.
3. Never claim done without CI-equivalent local gates (`npm run build` at minimum).
4. Never push secrets. Never weaken checks solely for green.
5. Never force-push main; no destructive git on shared history.
6. Smallest correct change; honor `AGENTS.md` (marketing/info website). Keep `INSTALL_COMMAND` single-sourced from `InstallCommand.tsx`.
7. Stay in marketing-site scope — do not turn issues into strike-cli Go/TUI implementation work in this repo.
8. `.plan/` optional research only — never required; never treat unscoped roadmap as the issue.
9. Stop-and-ask on ambiguity rather than guess.
10. Never merge with open blocking/should-fix findings from the latest pass on the **current** head SHA.
11. Always post review findings on the PR via `gh` (COMMENT review or comment) — chat-only review does not count.
12. Post reviewer findings verbatim; never omit or downgrade severity. Disputes → stop-and-ask.
13. Handler-authored automated reviews use `event: COMMENT` only — never self-APPROVE or self-REQUEST_CHANGES.

## Stop-and-ask

- `gh` auth/permission failures; unclear/contradictory acceptance criteria
- Foreign/unexpected dirty worktree; ambiguous path/branch collision; CI red outside branch after 2 reruns
- Merge conflicts with main you cannot resolve confidently (prefer `git merge origin/main` over rebase)
- Review requires product/design decision; would commit secrets or change CI/deploy/security unexpectedly
- Review loop still has blocking or should-fix findings after 5 passes
- Desire to drop or downgrade a reviewer’s blocking/should-fix finding
- Issue seems to require implementing the Go CLI rather than the marketing site

## What this skill is not

- Not unscoped roadmap implementer without a GitHub issue
- Not multi-agent orchestrator (beyond required PR review subagent / in-process review)
- Not a production deploy operator (merge to main triggers Actions deploy; do not SSH to the droplet from this skill)
- Not a substitute for sibling domain skills (`web-components`, `test-and-validate`)
